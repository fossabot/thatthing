Some personal site thing..?

Inspired by [this](https://www.rodrigotello.me/hellofuture/my-website-should-be-my-os), but I don't think they're similar lol

# Installing
I recommend you to install something more important and useful, but if you really really really really want to install it then
```
# needs docker-compose

# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/liimee/thatthing
cd thatthing

# create file .env, put:
# dbpass=<some password>
docker-compose up
```
